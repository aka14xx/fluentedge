Can you tell me your phone number?\"\n\nSara felt confused. She didn't remember having a friend named Ahmed in the game.\n\nShe thought: \"Should I answer? This person might be a stranger.\"\n\nSara remembered her teacher's lesson about internet safety. Her teacher always said: \"You shouldn't share personal information with people you don't know online.\"\n\nSara closed the chat and told her mom about the message. Her mom was proud of her.\n\n\"You made a very smart choice, Sara,\" her mom said. \"You can't trust everyone online. Always tell an adult if something feels wrong.\"\n\nFrom that day, Sara always thought carefully before chatting with anyone online. She knew that being safe was more important than being polite to strangers.",

Her friend Fatima was typing notes on her laptop.\n\nDuring the science lesson, the class was doing an online experiment. They were watching how plants grow in different conditions through a live camera.\n\n\"What were you doing at 10 a.m.?\" asked her mom after school.\n\n\"I was presenting my project using the projector!\" Amal said proudly. \"Everyone in class could see my photos of Nizwa Fort on the big screen.\"\n\nTechnology makes learning so much more interesting and interactive!",

They had to pick up trash by hand, which took hours.\n\n\"I want to invent a solar-powered robot that collects plastic from beaches!\" Ahmed announced.\n\nHis teacher smiled. \"That's wonderful! In the past, we couldn't use solar power for robots, but now we can!\"\n\nAhmed drew his invention. The robot had:\n✓ Solar panels for clean energy\n✓ Sensors to detect plastic\n✓ A container to store the trash\n\n\"When I grow up, I want to study engineering at Sultan Qaboos University,\" Ahmed said. \"Technology can help protect Oman's beautiful coastline!\"\n\nHis classmates loved the idea. Some students couldn't draw robots well, but they all had to try. Everyone felt excited about using technology for a better world.",

Her brother Ahmed enjoys learning about Omani history. The fort has tall towers and thick walls.\n\n\"Do you like castles?\" Ahmed asks.\n\n\"Yes, I do!\" Sara replies. \"They tell us stories about the past.\"\n\nIn the evening, they walk across Mutrah Corniche and see the beautiful bridge connecting different parts of the city. Muscat has many wonderful places!\n\n\"Which place is your favorite?\" their mother asks.\n\nSara thinks for a moment. \"I love them all, but the Grand Mosque is the most beautiful!\"",

Go straight ahead along this corridor. Then take the escalator to the second floor. The toy shop is next to the food court, on your left.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" they both say.\n\nThey follow the directions carefully. First, they walk along the corridor. The ceiling is very high and there are many shops on both sides. Then they see the escalator and go up.\n\nOn the second floor, they turn left and see the toy shop immediately!\n\n\"We found it!\" Maryam says happily.\n\nAhmed is proud. \"Now I know how to give directions in buildings!\"",

But why didn't you use a car?\"\n\nGrandfather smiles. \"There weren't many roads back then. People used to travel the old way. Camels were slower than cars, but they knew the desert well.\"\n\n\"Now it's so different!\" Ahmed says excitedly. \"Last week, we drove to Nizwa in just two hours. We visited the fort and the souq. It was fantastic!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Grandfather agrees. \"Modern travel is faster and more comfortable. But I think in the future, it will be even more amazing. Maybe you will fly there in a few minutes!\"\n\nAhmed imagines flying cars zooming over the mountains. \"I wonder what Nizwa will look like in 100 years,\" he says.\n\n\"The old fort will still be there,\" Grandfather says wisely. \"Some things don't change. But the ways we explore them do!\"\n\nAhmed feels grateful. He loves learning about the past and dreaming about the future.",

Robots like this help people in hospitals.\"\n\nNext, they see large computers. \"These are hardware,\" Dr. Ahmed says. \"The physical parts of computers. But computers also need software—programs that make them work.\"\n\nFatima raises her hand. \"We use apps on our phones. Is that software?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Dr. Ahmed smiles. \"Apps are software for smartphones. Your phone is a device with many functions.\"\n\nHe shows them medical machines. \"In Muscat's modern hospitals, doctors use advanced devices. These machines help diagnose illnesses and save lives.\"\n\nAli asks, \"Can robots do homework for us?\"\n\nEveryone laughs. \"Not yet!\" Dr. Ahmed says. \"But technology helps us learn. Apps can teach languages, and computers can store information.\"\n\nFatima thinks about all the devices around her: smartphones, washing machines, computers, robots.

They dug tunnels and calculated the slope perfectly. Water flowed by gravity—no pumps needed!\"\n\nAhmed is amazed. \"That's like ancient technology!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Grandfather smiles. \"People all over the world invented things to solve problems. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. The Wright Brothers built the first airplane. But our ancestors created the falaj to survive in the desert.\"\n\n\"Is it still used today?\" Ahmed asks.\n\nGrandfather nods. \"Some villages still use traditional falaj systems. UNESCO recognized them as World Heritage. Modern engineers study how our ancestors designed them so well.\"\n\nAhmed writes in his notebook: 'Omani engineers invented the falaj. They built it without modern tools. It worked for over a thousand years.'\n\n\"I'm proud of our history,\" Ahmed says.\n\n\"You should be,\" Grandfather replies. \"Innovation isn't just about new gadgets.

That means our address, phone number, or school name.\"\n\nMaryam nods. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"You have to ask permission before downloading new apps,\" Mother continues. \"And you don't have to answer messages from people you don't know. Just ignore them.\"\n\n\"What if someone is mean to me online?\" Maryam asks.\n\n\"You must tell me immediately,\" Mother says firmly. \"Cyberbullying is serious. Also, you mustn't be mean to others online either. Always be kind.\"\n\nMother shows Maryam the privacy settings. \"Keep your account private. Only accept friend requests from real friends.\"\n\nFinally, Mother talks about screen time. \"You don't have to be online all the time. Take breaks. Play outside. Read books. Balance is important.\"\n\nMaryam creates her safety rules list:\n• Must keep password secret\n• Mustn't share personal info\n• Must tell parents about problems\n• Don't have to respond to strangers\n\n\"Now you're ready!\" Mother smiles. \"Enjoy your tablet safely!\"",

Apps will remind elderly people to take their medicine. Air ambulances will reach remote villages faster.\"\n\n**Education:**\n\"Technology will improve learning,\" he continues. \"Students in mountain villages will attend online classes. Virtual reality will let us visit historical sites without leaving school. AI tutors will help students who need extra support. But teachers won't be replaced—they will always be important!\"\n\n**Environment:**\n\"Solar panels will power more homes and schools,\" Ahmed predicts. \"Electric cars will reduce pollution in Muscat. Smart systems will save water in the desert. Oman will become a leader in renewable energy.\"\n\n**Daily Life:**\n\"Robots will help farmers plant dates and harvest crops,\" he imagines. \"Delivery drones will bring medicine to remote areas. Smart traffic systems will reduce traffic jams.\"\n\nHis teacher reads the essay and smiles. \"Excellent work, Ahmed! But remember—technology won't solve everything alone. We need creative, kind people like you to use it wisely.\"\n\nAhmed nods. \"I will study hard. Maybe I'll become an engineer and help make these ideas real!\"\n\n\"I believe you will,\" his teacher says proudly.",
