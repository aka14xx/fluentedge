We studied Omani animals and learned about whiskers, fins, and claws. We practiced travel vocabulary and wrote about trips to Salalah and Nizwa. We discovered energy types — kinetic, potential, thermal, and electrical. We used grammar like present perfect, first conditional, and need/doesn't need. Now we can describe Oman confidently in English. What a fun year!",
