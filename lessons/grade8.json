The Ibri Solar Plant can power 50,000 homes!\"\n\nAhmed talked to his parents about installing solar panels at home. \"It will save money and help the environment,\" he said.\n\nHis father agreed. \"Solar energy is clean, sustainable, and perfect for Oman.\"\n\nAhmed and his classmates started a 'Green Club' at school. Every Friday, they plant trees and teach younger students about conservation.\n\n\"If every family does this,\" Ahmed thought, \"Oman will become a green energy leader.

Suddenly, she lost balance and fell, tumbling down with sand everywhere!\n\nBut Fatma didn't give up. She tried again. On her third attempt, she rode all the way down without falling!\n\n\"Best day of my life!\" she said. \"I proved I can do hard things!\"\n\nHer friend Salim prefers mountain biking at Jabal Akhdar. \"When I reach the top, I feel so proud!\" he said.\n\nMaryam loves scuba diving. She went to Daymaniyat Islands and saw three sea turtles! \"I learned to respect nature and not disturb marine life,\" she said.\n\nThe three friends love pushing themselves.

They had prepared for weeks.\n\nOn Friday morning, they loaded camping gear. \"Have you packed enough water?\" Ali's father asked. \"Yes, we had already bought ten bottles yesterday,\" Ali replied.\n\nWhen they arrived at the beautiful green valley, they set up tents. But they discovered they had forgotten the cooking stove! They had packed food but had left the stove at home.\n\n\"No problem,\" said Ali. \"We'll make sandwiches.\" They ate while watching the stunning sunset.\n\nAt midnight, Ali woke to strange sounds. Dark clouds appeared and rain started falling! Water came inside because they hadn't closed their tent properly. They quickly secured everything.\n\nThe storm lasted an hour. It was scary but exciting. In the morning, their tents had survived! They hung wet sleeping bags to dry and made hot tea.\n\n\"I had thought camping would just be relaxing,\" Ali said. \"But last night taught me we need to prepare for anything!\"\n\n\"We had forgotten to check the weather,\" Khalid agreed. \"Next time we'll be smarter.\"\n\n\"But we had helped each other fix the tents,\" Ahmed added. \"That's what matters.\"\n\nThey spent the morning swimming in the crystal-clear pools. Their trip hadn't gone as planned, but it was an unforgettable adventure!\n\nLesson learned: Always check equipment and weather. And remember - the best adventures include unexpected challenges!",

He also told me not to try it alone without proper training.\"\n\n\"Where can you learn?\" his father asked.\n\n\"He told me there's a school near Qantab Beach,\" Omar said.\n\nTheir mother asked Layla about diving. \"My friend told me about a diving center in Marina Bandar Al Rowdha. The instructors are very experienced.\"\n\nTheir father had an idea: \"This summer, we'll help each of you try ONE adventure sport. But you must take proper lessons and follow safety rules.\"\n\n\"Really?!\" both children exclaimed.\n\nTheir father shared his experience: \"When I tried rock climbing at Jabal Akhdar, my instructor told me to trust the rope and not look down. But I looked down and got scared! He told me to breathe slowly and not give up. I made it to the top!\"\n\n\"What advice would you give us?\" Layla asked.\n\n\"Be brave but smart. Listen to instructors. And enjoy the experience!\" their father said.\n\nThat night, Omar and Layla researched their sports carefully. They learned about safety, training, and preparation.\n\nTheir dreams were about to become reality - safely, with training, and with family support!\n\nSometimes, daring to try something new is the best decision you can make!",

Five groups researched different locations:\n\n**Group 1: Jabal Shams**\nAhmed's uncle told them to bring warm clothes because nights drop to 5¬∞C. The Balcony Walk is 6 hours of hiking with amazing canyon views. Start early to finish before dark!\n\n**Group 2: Wadi Shab**\nFatima's group visited on a field trip. Lessons learned: wear water shoes (rocks are slippery!), bring waterproof bags, and start early (it gets crowded). The final cave with waterfall was magical!\n\n**Group 3: Wahiba Sands**\nA desert guide told them sandboarding looks easy but climbing back up is exhausting! Go in winter (October-March) when it's cooler. Bring sunglasses - sun reflection is intense.\n\n**Group 4: Masirah Island**\nA kitesurfing instructor said Masirah has perfect wind from June-September. Beginners need 3-5 days of lessons. The island is remote, so bring all supplies.\n\n**Group 5: Musandam**\nA diving instructor said underwater life is amazing - corals, turtles, and dolphins! Best diving: October-May. Never touch coral - it's fragile and takes decades to grow.\n\nThe class compiled everything into one guide with maps, best seasons, checklists, and safety rules.\n\nTheir teacher, Mr. Ali, was impressed. He told them to remember:\n1. Adventure should be fun, not reckless\n2. Preparation prevents problems\n3. Respect nature - take only photos, leave only footprints\n\nThey called their project 'Young Explorers' Guide to Oman' and shared it online. Students from other schools used it to plan family trips!\n\n\"Oman has so much to offer,\" Sarah said. \"We don't need to travel far - adventure is right here!\"",

It was Ahmed's first time at the famous traditional market.\n\nInside, Ahmed saw narrow covered walkways, colorful lights, and smelled frankincense. \"This place is amazing!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThey walked through winding lanes with hundreds of shops - textiles, silver jewelry, perfumes, and traditional items.\n\nAhmed stopped at a shop selling a beautiful silver khanjar keychain. \"How much?\" he asked politely.\n\n\"Ten rials,\" the owner replied.\n\nAhmed counted his money - only seven rials. \"I don't have enough,\" he said sadly.\n\nHamad overheard. \"Don't worry, cousin. I'll pay for it! Consider it an early birthday present.\"\n\n\"Really? Thank you so much!\" Ahmed said gratefully. \"I'll pay you back next week.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Hamad smiled. \"But if you insist, help me with English homework instead!\"\n\nThe shop owner wrapped the keychain carefully and gave them a receipt. \"It's good to see young people helping each other,\" he said.\n\nAhmed attached the keychain to his school bag. \"Every time I see it, I'll remember today.\"\n\nThey continued shopping and watched a shopkeeper explain bargaining to tourists. \"In souqs, bargaining is tradition! I say one price, you offer lower, we meet in the middle!\"\n\n\"So that's how bargaining works,\" Ahmed whispered. \"But only in souqs - not in malls!\"\n\nBefore leaving, they had karak chai for 500 baisa per cup.\n\n\"Today was great. Thanks again!\" Ahmed said.\n\n\"Deal! English homework for the keychain!\" Hamad laughed.\n\nThe keychain wasn't just a souvenir - it was a reminder of family, generosity, and a wonderful day at Oman's famous market!",

If I saved half, I'd have money for the future.\n\nSecond, I would give 2,000 OMR to charity. If everyone helped others, Oman would have no poor families.\n\nThird, I would spend 2,000 OMR on my family. If I had that money, I'd take my parents on Umrah.\n\nFinally, I would use 1,000 OMR for myself. I'd buy a new laptop for school and a bike to ride with my friends.\n\nSome classmates said they'd spend everything on phones. But if you spend everything, you'll regret it later.\n\nMy teacher said, 'If you learn financial literacy young, you'll be successful.' Even with small amounts, we can practice saving wisely.",

At these places, they can touch the products, smell the frankincense, and talk to sellers face-to-face. Bargaining is common - you might buy something for 20 OMR when it was first priced at 30 OMR.\n\nBoth types of shopping have advantages. Online shopping is fast and convenient - you can compare one thousand products in minutes! But souqs are full of culture and history. When you walk through Muttrah Souq, you see traditional Omani crafts that are hundreds of years old.\n\nYoung people often prefer online shopping because it saves time. But during Eid and special occasions, families still visit souqs together. It's not just about buying - it's about the experience.\n\nSome Omani businesses now do both!

He loves these treats and thinks tourists would buy them as gifts. If he saved 500 OMR, he could buy ingredients and packaging materials.\n\nAhmed's father owns a shop in Muttrah Souq. He told Ahmed: 'If you started a business, you would learn many important skills - math, communication, and patience.'\n\nAhmed imagines his business: 'If I had 50 customers per week, I would earn about 200 OMR per month. If I saved half of that, I'd have 1,200 OMR in one year!'\n\nBut Ahmed also thinks about helping others. He says: 'If my business succeeded, I would donate 10% to charity. If everyone helped a little, Oman would have no poor families.'\n\nHis teacher asked the class: 'If you could start any business, what would you do?' Ahmed answered confidently: 'I would make Omani halwa famous around the world!'\n\nAhmed knows he needs to finish school first. But dreaming and planning helps him stay motivated. If he works hard now, his business dream could become real in the future.",
