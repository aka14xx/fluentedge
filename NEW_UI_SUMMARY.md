║  It's the first day of school after  ║
║  the long holiday.                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**After speaking (AI analyzed):**
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  It's the first day of school after  ║ (green text = correct)
║  the long holiday.                   ║ (green text = correct)
